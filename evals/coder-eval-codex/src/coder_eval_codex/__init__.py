"""A `codex-daily-driver` agent kind for `coder_eval`, so the eval suites run on Codex.

Import nothing from here at module scope that reaches `coder_eval`: `transcript`
is pure on purpose, so `scripts/check-codex-agent.py` can drive it with nothing
installed. `agent` and `plugin` are imported by name where they are needed.
