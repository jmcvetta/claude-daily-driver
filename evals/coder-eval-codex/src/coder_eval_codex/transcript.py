"""The turn transcript the judge reads, rendered — with no `coder_eval` in sight.

Everything in this module is pure: a string in, a string out. That is
deliberate, and it is the same split `coder_eval_omp/rpc.py` makes. The agent in
`agent.py` cannot be exercised without a `coder_eval` install and the Codex SDK,
so anything load-bearing that lives there is untested code. What is load-bearing
is here instead, and `scripts/check-codex-agent.py` drives it in `make check`.

One thing it owns, and it is a silent zero if it is wrong.

**The reply the judge reads.** Every judge rubric under `evals/tasks/` anchors
on the `[RESULT - …]` tag that `coder_eval`'s `format_messages` emits, and
scores 0.0 where the tag is missing — by design, so a drifted harness cannot
report a plausible number. `coder_eval` builds that transcript for its Claude
Code agent only; its Codex agent hands the judge `result_text`, the assistant
message deltas joined and nothing else. A Codex arm that did the same would
score every judged row 0.0, which is most of the `references` suites and both
halves of the constitution suite.

**What this module does NOT own, and why there is only one normalisation here
rather than the two the Omp arm needed.** A skill engagement is already visible
to `coder_eval`'s `skill_triggered` on Codex. That criterion matches
`skills/<name>/` in any string tool parameter and its own docstring names Codex
as the agent it was added for; `CodexAgent._setup_skills` links each plugin
root's skills into `<cwd>/.agents/skills/<name>/`, the Codex SDK types
`CommandExecutionThreadItem.command` as `str`, and `_extract_command_telemetry`
puts that string in `parameters["command"]`. So the path the model reads carries
the substring the criterion looks for, with nothing to rename. Issue #185 was
written expecting `skill://<name>` here, the spelling Omp uses; the spike in
#181 measured that Codex does not use it — the model reads `SKILL.md` itself and
`skill://` passes through as literal text.
