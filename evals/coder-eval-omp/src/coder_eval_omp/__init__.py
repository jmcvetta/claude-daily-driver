"""An `omp` agent kind for `coder_eval`, so the eval suites can run on Omp.

Import nothing from here at module scope that reaches `coder_eval`: `rpc` is
pure on purpose, so `scripts/check-omp-agent.py` can drive it with nothing
installed. `agent` and `plugin` are imported by name where they are needed.
