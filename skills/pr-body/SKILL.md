  This skill should be used whenever the body of a GitHub pull request is
  being written or revised — including when the user says "rewrite the PR
  description", "update the PR body", "the PR description is thin", or asks
  for more detail in a PR, and including any call Claude makes on its own
  initiative to `mcp__github__create_pull_request`, or to
  `mcp__github__update_pull_request` that sets a `body`. Supplies the required
  structure: one-line summary, salutation in verse, executive summary, and
  engineering detail. Not for the PR title — that is `pr-title`.

# PR Body

The body of a pull request, whether it is being opened or rewritten. In order:

- **One-Line Summary**: PR should begin with a very concise, single line summary of
  the PR. This summary will be visible in certain Github web UI components;
  there is a strict 85 character limit.
- **Salutation**: A poetic summary. Immediately after the one-line summary,
  separated by a blank line. A brief poem, in classical style, conveying the
  gist of the PR. Formatted in italics.
- **Executive Summary**: After the salutation, under heading "Summary", give a
  concise high level executive summary of the PR.  If you understand the
  importance of the PR for the larger software development or business
  perspectives, include that positioning.
- **Details**: After the summaries, include as much engineering detail as seems
  fitting.
- **Unopinionated**: This is a short description of the branch, NOT a code
  review. Do NOT do opine on code quality or security.

Issue references are the `pr` skill's concern. When it supplies an `Issues`
section, that section goes last, after the engineering detail.
